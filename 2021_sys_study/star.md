1. Until now, I did't know about that the simplicity of code is important thing. Today I realized its importance.
2. The most important difference between binary files and text files is that reading stops when reading null in text files, but not when reading null in binary files.
3. The difference between strcpy() and strdup() is that malloc() is used when user call strdup().
4. It is recommended to set the minimum byte for read and write to 512 bytes.
5. If user use malloc, realloc can be uesd for convenience.
