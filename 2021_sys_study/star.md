1. Until now, I did't know about that the simplicity of code is important thing. Today I realized its importance.

2. The most important difference between binary files and text files is that reading stops when reading null in text files, but not when reading null in binary files.

3. The difference between strcpy() and strdup() is that malloc() is used when user call strdup().

4. It is recommended to set the minimum byte for read and write to 512 bytes.

5. If user use malloc, realloc can be uesd for convenience.

6. The struct dirent is structured like this. Also, the format of the file can be known by d_type.

1. Today I studied about fread(), fwrite(). 
+ size_t fread(void * prt, size_t size, size_t count, FILE * fp) ;

    ptr : Pointer of the buffer with a size of the at least (size * count).

    size : Size of one element.

    count : Number of elements to read.

    fp : Pointer of FILE.

    return value : The total number of elements successfully read.

    ex : fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), fp) ;


+ fwrite(void * ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE * fp) ;

    ptr : Pointer of the buffer to be written

    size : Size of one element to be written.

    count : Number of elements to be written.

    fp : Pointer of FILE.

    return value : The total number of elements successfully written.

    ex : fwrite(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), fp);

2. I leared about 'goto' instruction. This simplifies the code when handling errors and increases readability.

1. What is socket? Communication between programs on a network. Therefore, nowdays most of the computer networks use socket for communicate each other. And there are some data structure and function which can help socket.

2. Flow of TCP/IP

3. int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol) ;
+ description
    It is like open socket.
+ int domain
    A parameter that determines whether to communicate on the Internet or between processes within the same system.. Most of case, 'PF_INET'(IPv4) is used for           domain.
+ int type
    Data transfer type. There are two tpyes which 'SOCK_STREAM'(TCP/IP) and 'SOCK_DGRAM'(UDP/IP).
+ int protocol
    Most of case, 0 is used for protocol.
+ return
    It return socket descriptor, likes namepipe.
    fail : -1.
    success : socket descriptor.
    
4. int bind(int sock_fd, struct sockaddr * myaddr, socklen_t addrlen) ;
+ description
    Assign the IP address and port number to the socket. Therefore, it is to prepare the socket to be used for communication.
+ int sock_fd
    Socket descriptor.
+ struct sockaddr * myaddr
    A struct sockaddr is entered for assignment to the socket.
+ socket_t addrlen
    The sizeof(myaddr) is entered.
+ return
    fail : -1.
    success : 0.
    
5. int listen(int sock_fd, int queue_size) ;
+ description
    The number of requests that can be processed from clients.
+ int sock_fd
    Socket descriptor.
+ int queue_size
    Waiting queue size.
+ return
    fail : -1.
    success : 0.
6. int accept(int sock_fd, struct sockaddr * addr, socklen_t * addrlen) ;
+ description
    It accepts the client's connect() request and creates a dedicated socket to communicate with the client.
+ int s
    Socket descriptor.
+ struct sockaddr * addr
    Pointer of the structure containing the address of the client.
+ socklen_t * addrlen
    The sizeof(addr) is entered.

1. Until now, I don't fully understand  about 'pointer" in C language. So I confused when using double pointer in sys_study time. After search the pointer concept in C, I cleared up some confusing concepts and make a diagram which help makes sense by myself.
+ What I confused. When I run this code, Segmentfault is occured.

+ What I understand.

So, In main(), the data which type is pointer should be used to call test() function by argument with reference which means '&'.
When do malloc() in test(), the argument should be dereference. Therefore, after finished test() function, data variable which declared in main() can not occurs segmentation fault.
